The University of Western Ontario!I am passionate about learning new things and what
interests me with software is its endless possibilities!

I am from Japan but grew up in Saudi Arabia, I would say my interests are football, learning, cooking, and fishing

This GitHub page is for me to upload my projects and try new things!
